# 🔧 Contact Page Direct URL Access Issue - RESOLVED

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

### **Issue Description:**
When directly accessing the `/contact` URL by typing it in the browser address bar or refreshing the page, it was failing with errors.

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
The issue was caused by an **import path conflict** with the `useToast` hook in the Contact component. There were two different `use-toast` files in the project:
- `/src/components/ui/use-toast.ts` (re-export wrapper)
- `/src/hooks/use-toast.ts` (actual implementation)

The Contact component was importing from the wrong path, causing runtime errors when the component tried to initialize.

---

## 🛠️ **SOLUTION APPLIED**

### **1. Fixed Import Path**
```tsx
// ❌ Before (Wrong import path)
import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast";

// ✅ After (Correct import path)
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
```

### **2. Cleaned Up Routing**
- Removed temporary debug components
- Restored clean App.tsx routing structure
- Verified SPA routing works correctly

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Maintained proper toast notifications
- Ensured graceful form submission
- Added proper error feedback
